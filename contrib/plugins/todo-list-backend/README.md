# Todo List Backend

This plugin was created to serve as an example for permission integration. It contains a basic backend for [the todo list plugin frontend](../todo-list/). Check out the docs [here](https://backstage.io/docs/permission/plugin-authors/01-setup) to learn more about how to integrate the permission framework into your own plugins.
