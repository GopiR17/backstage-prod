## What is it?

<!-- Intro, backstory, etc.: -->

TechDocs is Spotifyâ€™s homegrown docs-like-code solution built directly into
Backstage. This means engineers write their documentation in Markdown files
which live together with their code.

Today, it is one of the core products in Spotifyâ€™s developer experience offering
with 2,400+ documentation sites and 1,000+ engineers using it daily. Read more
about TechDocs and the philosophy in its
[announcement blog post](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs).

**TechDocs widget framework**

Platformize TechDocs with a widget framework so that it is easy for TechDocs
contributors to add pieces of functionality and for users to choose which
functionalities they want to adopt. As a pre-requisite, the re-architecture of
TechDocs frontend [RFC](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/3998)
needs to be addressed.
