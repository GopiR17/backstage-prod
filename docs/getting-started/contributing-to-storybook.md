## Creating a new Story

> A Story basically represents a single visual state of a component.

To create a new story, create a new file located alongside the component you want to document on Storybook.

See below an example of the structure:

```
core
└── src
    └── components
        └── Progress
            ├── Progress.tsx
            └── Progress.stories.tsx
```
