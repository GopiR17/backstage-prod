'@techdocs/cli': patch
---

Reunifies the [techdocs-cli](https://github.com/backstage/techdocs-cli) monorepo
code back into the main [backstage](https://github.com/backstage/backstage) repo
(see [7288](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/issues/7288)). The changes
include some internal refactoring that do not affect functionality beyond the
local development setup.
