Added a set of default Prometheus metrics around scaffolding. See below for a list of metrics and an explanation of their labels:

- `scaffolder_task_success_count`: Tracks successful task runs.

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `user`: The entity ref of the user that invoked the template run

- scaffolder_task_error_count: a count that track how many task runs error out

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `user`: The entity ref of the user that invoked the template run

- scaffolder_task_duration: a histogram which tracks the duration of a task run

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `result`: A boolean describing whether the task ran successfully

- scaffolder_step_success_count: a count that tracks each step run

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `step`: The name of the step that was run

- scaffolder_step_error_count: a count that tracks how many steps error out

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `step`: The name of the step that was run

- scaffolder_step_duration: a histogram which tracks the duration of each step run

  Labels:

  - `template`: The entity ref of the scaffolded template
  - `step`: The name of the step that was run
  - `result`: A boolean describing whether the task ran successfully
