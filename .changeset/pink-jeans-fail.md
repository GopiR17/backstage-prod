## New plugin: Score-card

Added by PR [#12488](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/12488). Main idea behind this plugin comes from a need to somehow visualize maturity of our services and to establish a process how to improve it (discuss with the teams what to focus on next).

There are following components"

- **score board**: overview of scored & reviewed systems
- **score card**: infocard in catalog to see detailed scoring for each system

There is also a suggested review process, presentation and an Azure DevOps integration pipeline with Sharepoint list "Selfassessment" form.
