# example-backend-next-gateway

This is an example backend for [the new Backstage backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/).

Do not use this in your own projects.

This backend specifically is an example gateway backend, that is a backend that handles registration of leaf node discovery information through the `@backstage/plugin-dynamic-discovery-backend` plugin.
