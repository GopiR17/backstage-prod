# {{id}}

Welcome to the {{id}} backend plugin!

_This plugin was created through the Backstage CLI_

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn
start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/{{id}}](http://localhost:3000/{{id}}).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/run.ts](/run.ts) file.

### New Backend System
The {{id}} backend plugin has support for the [new backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/), here's how you can set that up:
In your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` make the following changes:
```diff

+ import { {{pluginVar}} } from '@backstage/plugin-{{id}}-backend';
  const backend = createBackend();

+ backend.add({{pluginVar}}());

// ... other feature additions

  backend.start();
```
