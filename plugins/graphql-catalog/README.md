# Catalog GraphQL Plugin

A [GraphQL Module][graphql-module] providing access to the
[Backstage Software Catalog][catalog]

The plugin provides basic Catalog types, such as `Entity`, `User`,
`Component`, `System`, etc... and extends the [Directives
API][directives-api] with `@relation` directive.

You will almost always want to start by adding this plugin to your
[Graphql Backend][graphql-backend]

Some key features are currently missing. These features may change the schema in backward-incompatible ways.

1. `filter` query for filtering `nodes/entities`.
1. `viewer` query for retrieving data for the current user.

## GraphQL modules

### Catalog module

The `Catalog` module is installed just as any other [GraphQL
Module][graphql-modules]: pass it to GraphQL Application Backend Module
[`@backstage/plugin-graphql-backend`](../graphql-backend/README.md)

```ts
// packages/backend/src/modules/graphqlApplication.ts
import { createBackendModule } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';
import { graphqlApplicationExtensionPoint } from '@backstage/plugin-graphql-backend';
import { Catalog } from '@backstage/plugin-graphql-catalog';

export const graphqlModuleApplication = createBackendModule({
  pluginId: 'graphql',
  moduleId: 'application',
  register(env) {
    env.registerInit({
      deps: { application: graphqlApplicationExtensionPoint },
      async init({ application }) {
        await application.addModule(Catalog);
      },
    });
  },
});
```

### Relation module

If you don't want to use basic Catalog types for some reason, but
still want to use `@relation` directive, you can install `Relation` module

```ts
// packages/backend/src/modules/graphqlApplication.ts
import { createBackendModule } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';
import { graphqlApplicationExtensionPoint } from '@backstage/plugin-graphql-backend';
import { Relation } from '@backstage/plugin-graphql-catalog';

export const graphqlModuleApplication = createBackendModule({
  pluginId: 'graphql',
  moduleId: 'application',
  register(env) {
    env.registerInit({
      deps: { application: graphqlApplicationExtensionPoint },
      async init({ application }) {
        await application.addModule(Relation);
      },
    });
  },
});
```

## Directives API

### `@relation`

`@relation` directive allows you to resolve relationships between
entities. Similar to `@field` directive, it writes a resolver for you
so you do not have to write a resolver yourself. It assumes that
relationships are defined as standard `Entity` relationships. The
`name` argument allows you to specify the type of the relationship. It
will automatically look up the entity in the catalog.

1. To define a `User` that is the `owner` of a `Component`:

```graphql
type Component {
  owner: User @relation(name: "ownedBy")
}
```

2. The GraphQL server has baked in support for [Relay][relay]. By
   default, collections defined by a `@relation` directive are modeled as
   arrays. However, if the relationship is large, and should be
   paginated, you can specify it with `Connection` as the field type and
   use the `nodeType` argument to specify what the target of the
   collection should be.

```graphql
type Repository {
  contributors: Connection @relation(name: "contributedBy", nodeType: "User")

  # Or you can just use an array of entities
  contributors: [User] @relation(name: "contributedBy")
}
```

3. If you have different kinds of relationships with the same type you
   can filter them by `kind` argument:

```graphql
type System {
  components: Connection
    @relation(name: "hasPart", nodeType: "Component", kind: "component")
  resources: Connection
    @relation(name: "hasPart", nodeType: "Resource", kind: "resource")
}
```

## Catalog Data Loader (Advanced)

In most use cases, you will not need to create a Catalog `dataloader` by
hand. However, when writing [custom data loaders for accessing 3rd
party sources][custom-loader] or [rolling your own GraphQL Server
implementation][roll-your-own] you will need to provide the Catalog
loader yourself. This plugin provides the `createLoader` helper to do
just that.
