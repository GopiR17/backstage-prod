# apollo-explorer

Welcome to the apollo-explorer plugin!

## About

This plugin embeds Apollo Studio Explorer `@apollo/explorer` within Backstage.

## Getting started

Your plugin has been added to the example app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to access it by running `yarn start` in the root directory, and then navigating to [/apollo-explorer](http://localhost:3000/apollo-explorer).

You can also serve the plugin in isolation by running `yarn start` in the plugin directory.
This method of serving the plugin provides quicker iteration speed and a faster startup and hot reloads.
It is only meant for local development, and the setup for it can be found inside the [/dev](./dev) directory.
